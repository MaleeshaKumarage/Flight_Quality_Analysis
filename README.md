Solution for Inconsistency Issue

1.)Airport inconsistency
Arrival Airport should be similar to the next Departure Airport

2.)Flight time overlap inconsistency
Departure before previous arrival Time

3.)Negative duration inconsistency
Arrival time is before departure time

4.)Back-to-back airport Inconsistency
Departure and arrival airports are the same
